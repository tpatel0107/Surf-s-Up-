# Surf-s-Up-
Module 9 Challenge
## Purpose of the Analysis: Purpose of the Analysis is to provide W.Avy more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop  Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Our analysis will include Summary statistics for June and December
## Results
The following are the tables that summarize June's temperature statistics

The following are the tables that summarize December's temperature statistics over time

These two tables tell us about the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods. 
Some key takeways are: 
1) Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respictively, the temperature does not fluctuate a lot between teh two periods. 
2) The maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkablely similar. 
3) The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the December numbers. 

## Summary
Overall the weather in December and June are historically very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.

Additional queries that could be run include: Precipitation difference between June and December to determine if one has more rainy weather, as well as a comparison by weather station, as we may see highter/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
